# Project Name #
  Sharity

## Heading ##
   > A web platform where users can find organizations that need their donations and schedule pickups.

## Sub-Heading ##
   > Sharity is targeted towards users who want to easily find where to donate, as well as organizations that rely on donated goods from the community. 
  
## Summary ##
   > Donations are vital to our ability to enable non-profit organizations and shelters to serve our cityâ€™s most vulnerable. This pandemic has made it all the more difficult for people to come together and give back to their community. Sharity allows for users to contribute to those in need by giving them the ability to donate to these different organizations without having to leave the comfort of their home. For the organizations, Sharity gives them the opportunity to ask for items that are in high demand. Donors gain the convenience of scheduling pickups from their selected organization. Because of the direct access between donors and organizations, we're able to get resources to the individuals and families who need it most.


## Problem ##
   > Donation organizations have shortages on certain items that may not be known by donors. Donors of NYC lack a single-source of truth of where their donations are needed.

## Solution ##
   > Donors can easily see which organizations need certain items and send a pickup request to an organization through Sharity. Meanwhile, organizations have a dashboard of pickups, locations and times. 
    

## Key Technical Challenge ##
   > Our most challenging technical hurdle will be the implementation of the search feature. Users can find organizations based on the items they are donating. The frontend would require a responsive search.
  
## Extension Opportunities ##
   > 1. Users can add pictures of their donated items for more specified approval. 
   > 2. Organizations can view optimal pickup routes within their dashboard. 
   > 3. Geographical donation heat-map can be added to the home page, showing the organizations with the most need.
